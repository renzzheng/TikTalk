## Inspiration
With the pervasiveness of short-form content dominating entertainment and doom-scrolling becoming all too familiar, we attempted to transform this behavior into a more productive pastime. In this case, making this phenomenon more beneficial to users through an educational approach.

## What it does
TikTalk is a full-stack web application that generates tiktok-styled short-form videos after processing lecture mp4s/mp3s or pdfs notes. 

## How we built it
We used Firebase, Kafka, Docker, OpenAI Whisper, Google Gemini AI, Google Cloud, Google TTS, React, Next.js, Typescript, Flask, MoviePy.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest hurdles that we did not account for, was our group's ability to work together under pressure. It was an exercise for us in trying to figure out how to synergize with each other. 
During our development, each teammate explored new technologies to build our app, most of which were unfamiliar with us, and we attempted to incorporate a wide scope of dependencies within a short time frame. 
Determined to explore uncharted territory, we heavily relied on reading over the documentation for each respective technologies that we incorporated.
This setback for example, caused one simple issue during our enabling of Firebase, delaying our development process by several hours.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The majority of our teammates have never taken on the task of full-stack development. Coming together for our first hackathon, we set out with an incredibly daunting task, but we are all incredibly thrilled to claim that we have met this goal.
As such, one of our biggest achievements was maintaining clear communication and partitioning of project tasks to each individual team member.

## What we learned
As highlighted, we all deepened our understanding of full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, API and GenAI integration, and collaboration. We look forward to taking this newfound knowledge and experience, that is incredibly invaluable to us, for tackling future projects and to better ourselves.

## What's next for TikTalk
We plan to expand the capabilities of TikTalk to process larger files and additional file formats.
